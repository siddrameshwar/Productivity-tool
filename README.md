# Productivity-tool
An application to keep track of day-to-day activities to improve productivity.

I wanted to keep track of my day-to-day activities to improve my productivity. I didn’t find a proper productivity tool so I decided to build an application for the same. I built the backend for this application using Oracle DB, Oracle Application development framework and exposed it as REST API. I Built UI using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the Rest API as backend. 

There are 3 tables in this application. One for Today’s pending work. One for today’s completed task. One more for the All the tasks of all days. We can add a task for a particular day(by default today) and the Task without a day.

In this application, We can add the things we want to work on a particular day and the number of hours that we want to spend on that. We should keep updating the table as and when we finish some of those tasks. There is a table which will remind the users the pending tasks. 

I plan on implementing a graph which will showcase the number of hours a user spent on the tasks he/she planned. It will also showcase the number of hours not put in for each. The reason for this is many of us don’t really know how much time we are being productive. Many of us think we spend a lot more time on productive things than we actually do.
